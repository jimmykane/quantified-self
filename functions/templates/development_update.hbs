<p>Hi {{first_name}},</p>

<p>We have some exciting news to share about Quantified Self!</p>

<p><strong>We are back in development!</strong> After a pause, we are actively working on improving the platform to
    bring you the best self-tracking experience possible.</p>

<p><strong>Support Our Development</strong><br>
    Quantified Self is and will remain an Open Source project. By subscribing, you are becoming a patron of independent,
    privacy-focused tools and helping us keep a powerful alternative to big-tech platforms alive.</p>

<p>Your support directly funds the developer time needed to maintain this complex project and implement new features.
    We believe in transparency, and your subscription helps us accelerate our development cycle—bringing new features to
    "Live" much faster.</p>

<p><strong>Our Commitment:</strong> If we reach our sustainability goals, we commit to delivering at least one major
    feature update every month. Your subscription helps us make the service better and faster for everyone.</p>

<p><strong>New Service Tiers</strong><br>
    We now offer three simple tiers to suit your needs:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Free:</strong> Up to 10 activities (Perfect for trying it out).</li>
    <li><strong>Basic:</strong> Up to 100 activities.</li>
    <li><strong>Pro:</strong> Unlimited activities + <strong>Full Device Sync</strong> (Garmin, Suunto, COROS).</li>
</ul>
<p>You can view the full details and limits on our <a href="https://quantified-self.io/pricing"
        style="color: #03a9f4; text-decoration: none;">pricing page</a>.</p>

</p>

<p><strong>⚠️ Action Required: Database Renewal</strong><br>
    As part of our major infrastructure upgrade, the database has been completely renewed. <strong>You will need to <a
            href="https://quantified-self.io/login" style="color: #03a9f4; text-decoration: none;">create a new
            account</a></strong> to continue using the service. Once your new account is created, you can simply run a
    <strong>history import</strong> from your connected services, and all your data will be brought back into the new
    system.
</p>
